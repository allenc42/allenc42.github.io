### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite projects because I was able to use functions which we have never done before and we also make a blackjack game. I really find blackjack fascinating as a game and I grew up playing blackjack with my family. I found it really fun programming it because of the calculations we had to do for some of the cards. I got a better understanding of how functions worked through working on this project.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3, was also a good one. It was a fun program to make because I enjoy making anything involving simple games. It ultimately strengthen my usage of if statements and mathematical operations usages in c++. Although it was simple, I had a lot to learn from it.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 is another project I liked. I had fun using basic vectors in this program to create a calculator that found the average when given numbers. I find the idea of finding the average very interesting because we had to use a formula for it.
